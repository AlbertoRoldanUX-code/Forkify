This was the biggest and most complete project of the The Complete JavaScript Course by Jonas Schmedtmann.

The goal was to take everything that I learned in the last sections and put it all into one big project. 
I used things like classes, modules, promises, async/await and parcel.

Also, I dived deeper into flowcharts and project architecture.


---------------------------------------------------

This application is all about searching for recipes and displaying them on the UI.

- I implemented pagination to divide results into pages.
- I customized the recipe according to number of servings.
- You can bookmark recipes for later.
- You can also add your own recipes filling out a form.
